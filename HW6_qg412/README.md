# Assignment 1
Completing Prof's Skeleton notebook

### What I did
1) The relatively harder part of this exercise is figuring out how to download the data and put it into the desired folder to unzip, which for the past few assignments we have been relying on prof's prewritten code and no needing to modify or understand it further 
2) Completed the skeleton notebook 

### Groups and my contributions
I did this assignment mostly on my own, with error shooting help from Rachel @ rms, Vaidehi @ vvt221 and Kloe @ kyn227. Shoutout to Vaidehi for helping me check my logic for the last portion, defining the function.
