# Assignment 1
Completing Prof's Skeleton notebook

### What I did
1) The relatively harder part of this exercise is figuring out how to download the data and put it into the desired folder to unzip, which for the past few assignments we have been relying on prof's prewritten code and no needing to modify or understand it further 
2) Completed the skeleton notebook 

### Groups and my contributions
I did this assignment mostly on my own, with error shooting help from Rachel @ rms818, Vaidehi @ vvt221 and Kloe @ kyn227. Shoutout to Vaidehi for helping me check my logic for the last portion, defining the function.


# Assignment 2
There was a lot of confusion as to what is required for this particular assignment as Prof's Bianco instruction was to "follow Mr. Kryaschev's instructions". If we did that, the required submission would be what we covered in class i.e Lab. However, the same set of instructions also referenced to My Vo's notes, which included a separate set of homework instructions. I ended up doing BOTH sets- the files of interest are "Lab" and "Assignment2_qg412", the former follows Mr K's instruction while the latter follows Mr Vo's instruction. 

### What I did
Did 3 tasks each as per Mr K's and Mr Vo's instructions. Mr Vo's tasks were more challenging, where I learnt to use SQL to: 

1) Select columns of interest, 
2) Select rows of data according to date (using EXTRACT YEAR/MONTH/DATE from starttime) and specific days of the week (Using EXTRACT DOW from starttime)
3) Select rows of data according to specified physical distance using a very complicated formula... 

### Groups and my contributions
Thanks to fu who provided the website link on how to select rows of data according to specified physical distance, and Vaidehi @ vvt221 for explaining to me how to use that formula in my code. 

I did this piece of work on my own, with error proofing help from Vaidehi @vvt221, Rachel @ rms818 and kloe @kyn227.
