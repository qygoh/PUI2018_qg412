# Assignment 1

### What I did
Did fourier transformation, a continuation of last week's homework. The main file of interest here is Assignment1.ipynb. I did not complete the extra credit for this assignment. 

### Groupmates and my contributions
Worked with mei @yg833, kloe @kyn227 and rachel@rms818 for this assignment. Many thanks to mei@yg833 for taking time out to guide me through the concepts and Tiffany @tp1600 who provided me preliminary explanation of how to code the plots for the fourier transformation! 

I have also consultated prof bianco for this assignment, thanks for clarifying the concept behind fourier transformation and helping me error check some codes I couldnt get to work! 


# Assignment 2

### What I did
The main file of interest here is Assignment2.ipynb. Main personal achievement unlocked in trying to code many for loops to download the data! Did kmeans clustering for k=5 and k=7, as well as an additional hierarchial clustering. 


### Groupmates and my contributions
Worked with mei @yg833, kloe @kyn227 and rachel @rms818 for this assignment. Many thanks to shelly @yy2908 for providing me tips on how to loop through the initial unzipping and loading into a dataframe too!
