# Assignment 2

### What I did
All the segments until the chi-square portions where I got lost. I didnt manage to complete the homework and I have got no extensions left. 

### My contributions and groupmates
Thanks Jianwei @jl9200 who guided me through some of the plotting aspects of this assignment. 
Rachel @rms818 also helped me out with the chi-square function! 

I really struggled to understand and complete this homework so many thanks to Vaidehi @vvt221 who shared her code with me and guided me on the steps.
