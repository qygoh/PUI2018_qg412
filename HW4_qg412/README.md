# Assignment 1

On the generation of 5 different distributions with the extra credit on fitting a gaussian line on the plotted distributions. 

### What I did

1) Determined a fixed mean and seeded samples of varying size as required by assignment
2) Proceeded to plot scatterplots and a histogram for each of the 5 chosen distribution
3) Fitted a gaussian line on top of the histograms generated for extra credit

### Groups and my contributions

I did this piece of work in collaboration with Kloe @kyn227, Rachel Sim @rms818 and Vaidehi @vvt221. Many thanks to Rachel for explaining to me the concept of the lognormal function! 

Happy that I managed to figure out the plotting of the four distributions, as well as discovering the code for extra credit myself with minimal help! 


# Assignment 2

On using Citibike data to generate a null and alternative hypothesis as well as the cleaning and displaying of data. 

### What I did

1) Adapted the code to read and download data from Prof Bianco's example notebook.
2) Discussed with group mates on the formulation of the null and alterntive hypothesis, and how to clean the data thereafter
3) Cleaned the data such that it can be plotted later
4) Created 3 graphs that described the data

### Groups and my contributions

I did this piece of work in collaboration with Mei Guan @yg833 and Sam Falk @sjf374. Many thanks to Sam for figuring out the coding aspects and walking through with me the logic behind the codes used, especially for the Figure 2 plot as well as some of the data cleaning codes! 


# Assignment 3

On calculating Z-statistics from materials taught in class.

### What I did

1) Used curl to download the raw data from github
2) Calculated the various measures required for Z-statistics
3) Calculated Z-statistics
