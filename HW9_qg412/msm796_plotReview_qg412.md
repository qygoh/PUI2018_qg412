# The review: 

CLARITY: is the plot easy to read? is it clear or confusing, are the quantities being visualized ambiguous? 

ESTHETIC: beautiful is a subjective judgment: you should not judge the plot on the basis of whether you think it is "beautiful", but you should judge whether its esthetic is functional to what it is meant to communicate. Are the colors chosen appropriately? Are the graphical elements used appropriate to represent the quantities being visualized? Are the graphical choices allowing you to focus on the right elements or are they distracting you?

HONESTY: is the plot honestly reproducing the data or is it deforming it, perhaps to emphasize a point?

Important YOU MUST SUGGEST IMPROVEMENTS TO EACH PLOT!

**Clarity**: 

1) Generally the plots are clear and easy to read! I noticed that there were captions accompanying each plot in the assignment 1 notebook that was used to create the plots but it wasn't transferred into the readme.md file where the plots are ultimately displayed. So one suggestion would be to transfer the captions to the readme.md file to help improve clarity as captions help to improve understandability of the plots.  

2) The chosen quantiles for the plots displayed are fisher jenks. In my opinion this is an appropriate classification as the plots are not comparing across time, thus the jenks classification works as it will automatically calculates the optimal number of classes for the particular dataset at that snapshot in time. 

3) Some other suggestion to improve clarity, although it is on the nitpicking side: you can consider finetuning the labels for the legend- currently for both plots it is displayed as a float. Collectively it looks slightly more confusing as compared to if the labels are all integers instead. 

**Aesthetics**: 

1) The chosen color scheme for the plots is functional for its intended purpose, which in this case displays smaller values as darker plots and higher values in lighter shades. Lighter shades tend to be seen as the foreground and captures reader's attention to it first, which works for the purposes of these plots. 

2) One minor improvement in this category that I can think of is changing the shapefile outline to another color such as white so as to effectively delinate between the various boundaries. Currently, the boundaries are black, thus for areas with low concentration of pick up and drop off, the reader is not able to effectively tell where are the boundaries as the plot will be displayed as black color too. 

**Honesty**: 

1) I think the plots are great in this aspect- it is not deforming the data, but rather a display of data obtained directly from raw sources with minimal adjustments made to the data.
