# The review: 

**Clarity**: 

Generally, 

1) The plots rendered are huge. Not all information are displayed at one go and requires some scrolling to get a full picture of the plot. As a result, I would suggest putting a title at the top of each of the four plots so as to aid readers in understanding straight away what is the whole plot about, as opposed to the current arrangement where the caption and title is located at the bottom of the plot. 

2) I am a little confused as to the sudden focus on the rest of NYC in Figure 3 when all other plots have been about Manhattan only. Perhaps you can consider making Figure 3 the first plot, so that the plots kinda of tell a story of how we are looking at uber trips in NYC, and subsequently zooming into Manhattan only :) 

3) The current plots' captions can potentially be expanded to include more details to improve clarity- for example Figure 2,3,4, stating which quantile was utilized to classify the data and result in the visualisation would be great.  


**Asthetics**:

Generally,

1) I recommend turning off the axis labels to make the plots look more asthetically functional. Prof has mentioned previsouly that New York City is pretty distinct in shape and easily recognizable, hence having the axis is not a must. Otherwise, the axis labels must be labelled so that it serves its function. 

2) I think having an inplot legend/ label for data detailing what each dot mean would be helpful. For example, Figure 1's could be "Uber trip start location" and Figure 2 could be "Number of passenger" for example. 

Specifically for each plot:

1) I think it would be great if Figure 1 included a legend, maybe just show that a blue dot = uber's starting trip location so as to increase the understandability and functionality of the plot! 

2) Loved Figure 2's legend- it is very colorful! However, in the spirit of aesthetics, perhaps another way would be to utilize a discrete legend instead of the current continouous version as number of people is not continuous hence this legend's functionality is somewhat limited. 


**Honesty**: 

Generally,

1) I do honestly think that most plots are honestly reproducing the data- did not spot any signs of manipulation of data so as to emphasize a particular point.
