# Assignment 2

Plotted lines with error bars using two different methodologies and tried to overlay the best fit line ontop of the generated data points. 


### Groups and my contributions
Many thanks to Mei @yg833 as she shared with me some online resources that was helpful for this assignment as well as guiding me how to do this assignment. 


# Assignment 3

### What I did
Downloaded and cleaned the data to conform into desired formats, plotted lots of plots inclusive of those with errorbars but did not manage to complete any of the extra credit for this assignment. 

### Groups and my contributions
Discussed this assignment with Mei @yg833 and I did this piece of work independently, up till the modelling portion of this assignment, where I was guided by Vaidehi @vvt221. 

Many thanks to Mark Bauer @mebauer for walking through with me the deliverables of the plots too.
