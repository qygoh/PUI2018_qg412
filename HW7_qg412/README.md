# Assignment on Geopandas

### What I did
1) Did a lot of joining and merging of various dataframes. As a result of that, one of the learning point for me was that it is very important to check the data types of the data! A lot of times things don't work downstream due to different data types. 

2) Plotted a lot of maps. My most important takeaway was getting familarized with the python code 'interface' on how to customize maps! 

3) Did both extra credit assignment. Learnt that its actually possible to do spatial autocorrelation in python and using geopandas! 


### Groupmates and my contributions
I am extremely happy for being able to complete the mandatory portions all by myself with minimal help from my friends! Meanwhile, many thanks to Vaidehi @vvt221 and Rachel @rms818 for guiding me on the concepts on what to do for extra credit 2! 

Many thanks to Vaidehi @vvt221, Kloe @rms811, Rachel @rms818 and Mei Guan @yg833 who were there for me to errorproof my code, and ask questions on if I am moving in the right track. We also came out with the idea and code to rename the unzipped files for puma shape file, because they were different names for each unzip.
