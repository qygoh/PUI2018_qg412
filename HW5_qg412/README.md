# Assignment 2 
On understanding how academic papers utilize statistical tests. No specific files for this assignment, it is all in this markdown. 

### What I did

1) Chose 3 statistical tests - ANOVA, Path Analysis and logistic regression

2) Summarized 3 papers from PLOS ONE for each of the chosen tests in the table below: 

| **Statistical Analyses**	|  **Independent Variable(s)**  |  **IV type(s)** |  **Dependent Variables(s)**  |  **DV type(s)**  |  **Control Var** | **Control Var type**  | **Question to be answered** | **_H0_** | **Alpha** | **Link to paper**| 
|:----------:|:-------|:------------|:-------------|:-------------|:------------|:------------- |:------------------|:----:|:-------:|:-------|
ANOVA	| 2. IV1: Sleep for 12 hours. IV2: Wake for 12 hours | Categorical | 1: Performance in The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) | Categorical | 1: Sleep and wake for 12 hours respectively | Categorical |	Does intervening sleep between sessions enhance performance in IGT? | IGT Performance test groups <= IGT Performance control group | 0.05 | [Post Learning Sleep Improves Cognitive-Emotional Decision-Making: Evidence for a ‘Deck B Sleep Effect’ in the Iowa Gambling Task](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0112056) |
Path Analysis | 7. (X1)women age, (X12) place of residence, (X3)religion, (X4) socioeconomic status, (X5) use of family planning methods, (X6) women education, (X7) age at first marriage | Categorical | 1: Number of unwanted births | Continuous | 1: Sleep and wake for 12 hours respectively | Categorical |	 to know the important covariates for unwanted births in Bangladesh. | IGT Performance test groups <= IGT Performance control group | 0.05 | [Correlates of Unwanted Births in Bangladesh: A Study through Path Analysis](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0164007) |
Logistic Regression |2. IV1: Sleep for 12 hours. IV2: Wake for 12 hours | Categorical | 1: Performance in The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) | Categorical | 1: Sleep and wake for 12 hours respectively | Categorical |	 to know the important covariates for unwanted births in Bangladesh. | IGT Performance test groups <= IGT Performance control group | 0.05 | [Correlates of Unwanted Births in Bangladesh: A Study through Path Analysis](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0164007) |

3) Provide screenshots of the main plot of the 3 selected papers: 

![screenshot](anova_main.png)

Figure 1: ANOVA Paper's main plot. Subplot A shows that overall, the sleep group improved the most compared to sleep-wake and wake groups. Subplot B shows the choices made by participants for each deck in IGT: Choice of deck A and B are considered bad choices, while choices C and D are considered good choices. Improvement is reflected by a negative percent change in deck A and B and positive percent change in deck C and D.

Figure 2: Path Analysis Paper's main plot. There are in total 7 predictors analyzed: (X1)women age, (X12) place of residence, (X3)religion, (X4) socioeconomic status, (X5) use of family planning methods, (X6) women education, (X7) age at first marriage for their effect on the dependent variable (X8)unwanted births.

### Groups and my contributions
Did this on my own, but double checked my answers with kloe @ kyn227, vaidehi @ vvt221 and rachel @ rms818. 


# Assignment 3
On reproducing results of existing literature. The main file for this assignment is _HW5_qg412_. 

### What I did
1) Download Prof Bianco's skeleton notebook and made further changes to it
2) Read up on Z-test and Chi-square test
3) Wrote the null hypothesis for Recidivism 
4) Modified Prof Bianco's code to answer the question for Z-Test
5) Filled in contingency table for chi-square test
6) Created a user-defined function that is capable of conducting chi-square test when called

### Groups and my contribution
I managed to do this by myself! Yaye. Double checked my answers with Vaidehi @ vvt221. 


# Assignment 4
