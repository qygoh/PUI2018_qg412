I did this piece of work on my own, as designated by the instructions. 


# Assignment 2 
On understanding how academic papers utilize statistical tests. No specific files for this assignment, it is all in this markdown. 

### What I did

1) Chose 3 statistical tests - ANOVA, Multiple regression and logistic regression

2) Summarized 3 papers from PLOS ONE for each of the chosen tests in the table below: 

| **Statistical Analyses**	|  **Independent Variable(s)**  |  **IV type(s)** |  **Dependent Variables(s)**  |  **DV type(s)**  |  **Control Var** | **Control Var type**  | **Question to be answered** | **_H0_** | **Alpha** | **Link to paper**| 
|:----------:|:-------|:------------|:-------------|:-------------|:------------|:------------- |:------------------|:----:|:-------:|:-------|
ANOVA	| 2. IV1: Sleep for 12 hours. IV2: Wake for 12 hours | Categorical | 1: Performance in The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) | Categorical | 1: Sleep and wake for 12 hours respectively | Categorical |	Does intervening sleep between sessions enhance performance in IGT? | IGT Performance test groups <= IGT Performance control group | 0.05 | [Post Learning Sleep Improves Cognitive-Emotional Decision-Making: Evidence for a ‘Deck B Sleep Effect’ in the Iowa Gambling Task](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0112056) |
Logistic Regression |

3) Provide screenshots of the main plot of the 3 selected papers:

Figure 1: ANOVA Paper's main plot. Subplot A shows that overall, the sleep group improved the most compared to sleep-wake and wake groups. Subplot B shows the choices made by participants for each deck in IGT: Choice of deck A and B are considered bad choices, while choices C and D are considered good choices. Improvement is reflected by a negative percent change in deck A and B and positive percent change in deck C and D.

### Groups and my contributions
Did this on my own, but double checked my answers with kloe @ kyn227, vaidehi @ vvt221 and rachel @ rms818. 


# Assignment 3
On reproducing results of existing literature. The main file for this assignment is _HW5_qg412_. 

### What I did
1) Download Prof Bianco's skeleton notebook and made further changes to it
2) Read up on Z-test and Chi-square test
3) Wrote the null hypothesis for Recidivism 
4) Modified Prof Bianco's code to answer the question for Z-Test
5) Filled in contingency table for chi-square test
6) Created a user-defined function that is capable of conducting chi-square test when called

### Groups and my contribution
I managed to do this by myself! Yaye. Double checked my answers with Vaidehi @ vvt221.
